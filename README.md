This line of TypeScript code is an import statement that imports the readline module. Let's break it down:

import: This is a keyword in TypeScript used to import functionalities from other modules.

* as readline: Here, * represents importing everything from the module, and as readline assigns the imported
* 
* module to a local variable named readline. This syntax allows us to refer to any functionality exported by
* 
* the readline module using the readline variable.

'readline': This is the name of the module we're importing from. In this case, it's a built-in module in Node.js 

called readline. The module provides an interface for reading data from a Readable stream (such as process.stdin)

one line at a time.

So, this line essentially imports the entire readline module and makes it accessible through the readline variable,

enabling us to use its functionalities, such as creating an interface for reading user input.
